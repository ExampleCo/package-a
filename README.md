Example TypeScript package

[![ci](https://github.com/exampleco/package-a/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/exampleco/package-a/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is an example package that does a thing. It's written in TypeScript, which unfortunately still compiles to JavaScript.

This is a good package.
